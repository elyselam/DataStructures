package HashTable;
/*
abstract data type,
data types don't have to match, optimized for retrieval if you know the key
as
collision: happens when more than 1 value has the same hashed value
function: Object.hashCode(). maps keys of any data type to int
Load Factor: how full a hash table is. used to decide when to resize the array backing the hash table
            the higher LF: the more likely of collisions
            # items / capacity = size / capacity
            determine time complexity for retrieval
add to HashTable backed by an array:
1) provide k/v pair
2) use hash function to hash key into int
3) store index into the array
