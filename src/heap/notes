Heap is a tree based DS with heap property.
Max Heap: a parent node > children

Priority Queue is an Abstract Data Type, similar to queue except each element has a certain priority
priority of elements determine the order of their removal. can be implemented with other DS

Complexity PQ with Binary Heap
Construction: O(n)
Polling()(removing root): O(log(n))
Adding: O(log(n))
Peek: O(1)
naive removing: O(n)
hash table removing: O(log(n))
naive contains(): O(n)
hash table contains(): O(1)
